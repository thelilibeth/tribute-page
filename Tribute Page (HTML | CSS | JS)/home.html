            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="year">1933</span> <br />
              Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota,
              thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth
              Administration"
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="year">1935</span> <br />
              Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian
              Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food
              changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="year">1937</span> <br />
              Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service

              <span class="year">1938</span> <br />
              Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to
              budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to
              school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding
              pest-resistent plants.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="year">1941</span> <br />
              Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but
              is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on
              waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other
              applied science.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="year">1942</span> <br />

            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="year">1944</span> <br />
              Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his
              pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology
              program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different
              strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties
              for each major climate on Earth.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="year">1945</span> <br />
              Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat
              yields
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="year">1953</span> <br />
              Crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a high-yeidling
              American breed, creating a strain that responds well to
              fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="year">1962</span> <br />
              Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to the
              Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due
              to a rapidly expanding population
            </li>

              States "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050."
              Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can
              meet the demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops
              are not inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically
              modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we
              called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="year">2009</span> <br />
